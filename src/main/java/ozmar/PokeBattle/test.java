    BINDING MOVES
    These moves partially trap the foe and deal a small amount of damage for anywhere between two and five turns
    in Generations I-IV and for four to five turns in Generation V. If the user of a partial trapping move is holding
    a Grip Claw, the move will last for 7 turns (5 turns prior to Generation VI). A Pokémon can be only affected by
    one partial trapping move at a time.
        Bind (move)             Clamp (move)        Fire Spin (move)    Infestation (move)

    CONSECUTIVELY EXECUTED MOVES
    These are moves that are automatically used for one or more turns after being selected, only using 1 PP in
    the process. These moves will continue to execute, even when the user is affected by Torment.
    A similar move, Bide, causes the user to wait for two turns (2-3 turns prior to Generation IV); after those
    turns, Bide inflicts damage to the last Pokémon that damaged it equal to double the amount of damage it took
    during those turns.

        MOVES THAT CONFUSE A USER DUT TO FATIGUE
        These are moves that automatically execute for 2-3 turns after being selected, and then confuse
        the user after it has finished.
            Outrage (move)
            Petal Dance (move)
            Thrash (move)


    DECREASED PRIORITY MOVES
    These moves have decreased priority. If a Pokémon uses one of these moves, it will go after other higher
    priority moves that turn. If other Pokémon in the battle also use an decreased priority move with the
    same value, the attack order will be determined normally.

    HP DRAINING MOVES
    These moves restore a portion of their user's HP after damaging an opponent, healing a set percentage
    of the damage inflicted.
    Holding a Big Root will increase the amount of HP recovered with these moves, without altering the
    move's base power. If used on a Pokémon with Liquid Ooze (except Dream Eater prior to Generation V), the
    user will take equivalent damage instead of being healed.
    A similar move, Strength Sap, also restores the user's HP, but lowers the opponent's Attack instead of damaging it.

    INCREASED PRIORITY MOVES
    These moves have increased priority. If a Pokémon uses one of these moves, it will go before other lower
    priority moves that turn. If other Pokémon in the battle also use an increased priority move with the
    same value, the attack order will be determined normally.
